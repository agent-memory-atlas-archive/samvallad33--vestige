//! # strata — the Causal Proof Engine's log layer
//!
//! STRATA is not a database. It is the Causal Proof Engine: it commits,
//! attests, and testifies — never serves queries. This crate is the
//! append-only, fail-stop foundation.
//!
//! Segment files (`NNNNNNNN-<uuid>.seg`) hold a borsh-encoded header, a chain
//! of hash-linked frames, and a signed trailer (see [`crate::format`]).
//!
//! ## Commit protocol (fail-stop, TigerBeetle-style)
//!
//! `WRITING -> SYNCING -> VERIFYING -> DURABLE -> ACK`
//!
//! * **WRITING**: frame bytes are appended at the end of the active segment.
//! * **SYNCING**: one durability barrier per commit group. Linux:
//!   `fdatasync`. macOS: `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` — on APFS a plain `fsync` only
//!   drains the kernel page cache and does not force the drive to acknowledge
//!   the write to stable storage, so we pay for the full barrier.
//! * **VERIFYING**: every frame is pread back and its blake3 recomputed; any
//!   mismatch or I/O error triggers a deliberate `panic!` carrying a
//!   fail-stop report `{last_acked_seq, op, errno}`. No retry, no fallback.
//! * **DURABLE**: the `head.state` watermark (`last_acked_seq`) is replaced
//!   atomically (temp file + fsync + rename + directory fsync).
//! * **ACK**: [`SeqAck`] is returned only after verify + watermark.
//!
//! In production binaries, build with `panic = "abort"` so a fail-stop panic
//! takes the process down; the library uses `panic!` (not a hard `abort`) so
//! tests can exercise the path with `catch_unwind`.
//!
//! ## Group commit (v1)
//!
//! Frames queued within a <=2ms coalescing window or <=64 frames share one
//! sync. v1 is a synchronous leader/follower design behind one mutex plus one
//! condvar: the first appender becomes the batch leader, holds the window open
//! for more frames, then runs the whole pipeline while later appenders queue
//! and wait. There is no dedicated flusher thread yet (documented v1
//! simplification), so a lone append also pays the 2ms window. Batch-heavy
//! callers should use [`StrataLog::append_batch`].
//!
//! ## Recovery
//!
//! On open every segment is scanned: frame blake3s and chain links are
//! recomputed. A sealed segment's trailer is verified whether or not
//! `head.state` exists; any mismatch halts. Only the unsealed active tail
//! may be truncated, and only at a torn final write above the acked
//! watermark. Any other damage returns [`StrataError::Halt`] — history is
//! never truncated.
//! A fully-written, chain-valid frame above the watermark that survived the
//! crash is retained: its bytes are durable, only its ack was lost, and the
//! watermark is not advanced for it.
//!
//! ## Single writer
//!
//! Enforced by `strata.lock`, created with `O_EXCL`, holding the owner pid.
//! Stale locks are detected best-effort with a `kill(pid, 0)` liveness probe;
//! the probe/unlink pair is racy (TOCTOU) and an unparseable or empty lock
//! file is treated as held. Remove the file by hand if a writer crashed
//! between creating the lock and writing its pid.
