# Operator Lite -- Cursor port end-to-end test. POSIX sh, stdlib-only.
#
# Hermetic: builds a throwaway HOME (NOT under /tmp: the gate classifies system
# temp as scratch, which would never exercise OP-003), runs the real install.sh
# into it, then drives the REAL installed adapter command with payloads in the
# EXACT stdin shapes Cursor documents:
#
#   common envelope : {conversation_id, generation_id, model, model_id,
#                      model_params, hook_event_name, cursor_version,
#                      workspace_roots, user_email, transcript_path}
#   beforeShellExecution adds : {command, cwd, sandbox}
#   beforeMCPExecution   adds : {tool_name, tool_input (JSON string),
#                                mcp_server_name, url}
#   preToolUse           adds : {tool_name, tool_input (object), tool_use_id,
#                                cwd, agent_message}
#
# Cursor's permission hooks decide through STDOUT JSON ("permission": "deny"
# blocks; invalid output blocks too), so unlike the goose/gemini ports the
# block verdict is asserted on stdout at exit 0 -- not exit 2.
#
# Nothing is ever executed: payloads are only piped into the adapter as JSON,
# and the gate is analyzer-only. The EXIT trap removes every trace.
