//! The store's card fold: reviews plus imported v3 card states.
//!
//! Admitted `ReviewNode` ops, ingest reviews, and the importer's
//! `FSRS_REVIEW` frames fold as kernel [`ReviewEvent`]s. An upgraded v3
//! memory also arrives as an `FSRS_STATE` frame that carries the card
//! itself: its stability, difficulty, and counters are not reproducible
//! from any rating series. [`CardEvent`] puts both on one fold, so a store
//! checkpoint's state root covers imported cards and the kernel verifier
//! ([`strata_kernel::verify::verify_with_head`]) replays them like any other
//! event. Reviews fold under the pinned kernel of the checkpoint's version;
//! an import sets the card once and is identical under every version.
