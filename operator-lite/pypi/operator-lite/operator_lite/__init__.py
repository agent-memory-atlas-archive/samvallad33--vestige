"""operator-lite: one pip-installable front door for the Python Operator Lite ports.

The gate is NOT in this wheel. One stdlib-only file -- the external
``operator-gate.py`` -- owns every decision; this package only carries its
contract to three Python agent frameworks. At call time each adapter locates
(installs) the gate exactly like the repo ports do:

    1. $OPERATOR_GATE                        (explicit override, re-read per call)
    2. $OPERATOR_HOME/gate/operator-gate.py  (non-default operator home)
    3. ~/.operator/gate/operator-gate.py     (the installed copy)

``operator_lite.ensure_gate()`` can fetch the gate from upstream (same URL the
ports' install.sh uses) into ~/.operator/gate/, never overwriting a
same-or-newer copy, and refusing to run inside an agent session.

Gate contract (unchanged from the ports):
    spawned as:  python3 <gate> hook --source <host>
    stdin:       {"tool_name": ..., "tool_input": {"command": ...},
                  "cwd": ..., "session_id": ...?}
    exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (reason on stderr)
    shadow vs enforce is a file: ~/.operator/mode (shadow default)

Everything decision-bearing lives in the gate. This package is payload shaping
and plumbing only -- no rule logic, no analysis. Stdlib-only at import time;
framework imports (langchain / crewai / agents) happen lazily on first use.
